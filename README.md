## The purpose of this repository
* Supporting blue team members writing Suricata rules for the new critical vulnerabilities to detect and prevent the exploitation of attackers as soon as possible.
* Updating Suricata rules regularly and holding them in a well-managed database.

Each folder has 2 main parts:
* The file README.md includes 3 parts:
  * Overview of the vulnerability
  * Proof of Concept (PoC) or in other words, the samples of the malicious payloads
  * References
* The file .rules holds the Suricata rule itself.
